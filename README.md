The main idea for this project is to create my own web version of the dnd character sheet. It is also a way to make it easier to look through all of the information you retrieve throughout the game. 
This projects intrests me because I love dnd but it can be quite troublesom with the character sheets they have. The information gathers quickly and you can end up forgetting somethings that your character can do. 
The ambitious version of this idea is to create a version for the DM, so they can keep track of their world building and their chracters they have. Maybe have a way so you can create a group through the website so you can see the names of the characters in your campaign. Having a feature to digitally roll dice would be an interesting idea. 
The target version is a 'homepage' where you can see your current character (shows a little information on each character) when clicked on character shows the character information for when you need it, having different tabs at the top for your characters backstory, spells, inventory. 
The smallest working version is basic information for your character, a page that has a very similar layout to the actual dnd character sheet.
